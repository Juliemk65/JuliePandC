Welcome to my personal project that reflects my pet-sitting business of two years! This was website was never launched or made public, but if a website had to be created this would best represent my services. It contains sections that show the team and our passion, 5-start reviews from clients, a booking page, and an admin section. Have concerns or questions about any services or special requests for your furry companion? We have a section to reach out to us as well. The booking page lets you submit a request once ALL fields have been filled/selected at least once. The admin page, with a special login (username: Julie password: 1234), allows you to store info. about new clients, or lookup an existing we have serviced. It will return a picture of the client's pet and info. The information is coming from a MongoDB that is connected in the Server1 file under index.js. New client forms that are submitted will also be sent to the MongoDB that can be looked up. This is a list of current clients that can be looked up: -Elaine -Stephanie -Jill -Jay -Lura -Lina -Anna -Caitlin -Kyle -Lexi -Emily -Courtney -Michael -Rebecca -Jiwon -Stacey -Josh -Racheal -Erica -Brennan -Raja -Andrew -Justin -Julie -Brian

Enjoy browsing around and seeing the cute faces that pop up! (: Look up 'Julie' to see my parrot too ðŸ˜„

Launching instructions: npm start must be ran seperately on backend file first and then frontend file in the terminal. Thank you!!!
